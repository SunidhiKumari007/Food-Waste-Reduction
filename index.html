    and encourage sustainable practices in our communities. By offering valuable resources, tools, and insights,

<h2>What We Do</h2>
<p>Our platform connects people who have surplus food with those in need.We provide a simple and effective way for donors to share what food they have and 
    how much is available, so those facing food insecurity can access it quickly and easily.
    Through our website, donors can list the types and quantities of food they are willing to share, along with location details. On the other hand, 
    individuals or organizations in need can browse available donations and arrange for pickup or delivery. By facilitating this exchange, 
    we aim to reduce food waste, help those in need, and foster a sense of community.
    Together, we can make a difference by sharing what we have and ensuring that no food goes to waste.</p>
